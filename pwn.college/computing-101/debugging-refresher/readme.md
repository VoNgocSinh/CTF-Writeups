### Level 1 - Debugging Programs

This level gets you re-familiarized with gdb.
To get started with this level, and all the other levels of this module, run `/challenge/embryogdb_levelXYZ`, where XYZ is the level number.
That program will launch `gdb`.
Run the actual level logic with `r`, and follow the prompts to get that flag!

### Level 2 - Inspecting Registers

Next, we'll learn about how to print out the values of registers.

You can see the values for all your registers with `info registers`. Alternatively, you can also just print a particular
register's value with the `print` command, or `p` for short. For example, `p $rdi` will print the value of $rdi in
decimal. You can also print its value in hex with `p/x $rdi`.

In order to solve this level, you must figure out the current random value of register r12 in hex.

As before, start the challenge, invoke the `run` gdb command, then follow the instructions.
When you've printed out what you need, remember to `continue` to move on to the next step of the challenge!

### Level 3 - Examining Memory

Next, we'll learn to use gdb to peek into process memory!

You can e**x**amine the contents of memory using the `x/<n><u><f> <address>` parameterized command. In this format `<u>` is
the unit size to display, `<f>` is the format to display it in, and `<n>` is the number of elements to display. Valid
unit sizes are `b` (1 byte), `h` (2 bytes), `w` (4 bytes), and `g` (8 bytes). Valid formats are `d` (decimal), `x`
(hexadecimal), `s` (string) and `i` (instruction). The address can be specified using a register name, symbol name, or
absolute address. Additionally, you can supply mathematical expressions when specifying the address.

For example, `x/8i $rip` will print the next 8 instructions from the current instruction pointer. `x/16i main` will
print the first 16 instructions of main. You can also use `disassemble main`, or `disas main` for short, to print all of
the instructions of main. Alternatively, `x/16gx $rsp` will print the first 16 values on the stack. `x/gx $rbp-0x32`
will print the local variable stored there on the stack.

You will probably want to view your instructions using the CORRECT assembly syntax. You can do that with the command
`set disassembly-flavor intel`.

In order to solve this level, you must figure out the random value on the stack (the value read in from `/dev/urandom`).
Think about what the arguments to the read system call are.

### Level 4 - Settings Breakpoints

A critical part of dynamic analysis is getting your program to the state you are interested in analyzing.
So far, these challenges have automatically set breakpoints for you to pause execution at states you may be interested in analyzing.
It is important to be able to do this yourself.

There are a number of ways to move forward in the program's execution.
You can use the `stepi <n>` command, or `si <n>` for short, in order to step forward one instruction.
You can use the `nexti <n>` command, or `ni <n>` for short, in order to step forward one instruction, while stepping over any function calls.
The `<n>` parameter is optional, but allows you to perform multiple steps at once.
You can use the `finish` command in order to finish the currently executing function.
You can use the `break *<address>` parameterized command in order to set a breakpoint at the specified-address.
You have already used the `continue` command, which will continue execution until the program hits a breakpoint.

While stepping through a program, you may find it useful to have some values displayed to you at all times.
There are multiple ways to do this.
The simplest way is to use the `display/<n><u><f>` parameterized command, which follows exactly the same format as the `x/<n><u><f>` parameterized command.
For example, `display/8i $rip` will always show you the next 8 instructions.
On the other hand, `display/4gx $rsp` will always show you the first 4 values on the stack.
Another option is to use the `layout regs` command.
This will put gdb into its TUI mode and show you the contents of all of the registers, as well as nearby instructions.

In order to solve this level, you must figure out a series of random values which will be placed on the stack.
As before, `run` will start you out, but it will interrupt the program and you must, carefully, continue its execution.

You are highly encouraged to try using combinations of `stepi`, `nexti`, `break`, `continue`, and `finish` to make sure you have a good internal understanding of these commands.
The commands are all absolutely critical to navigating a program's execution.

### Level 5 - GDB Scripting

---

We write code in order to express an idea which can be reproduced and refined.
We can think of our analysis as a program which injests the target to be analyzed as data.
As the saying goes, code is data and data is code.

While using gdb interactively as we've done with the past levels is incredibly powerful, another powerful tool is gdb scripting.
By scripting gdb, you can very quickly create a custom-tailored program analysis tool.
If you know how to interact with gdb, you already know how to write a gdb script--the syntax is exactly the same.
You can write your commands to some file, for example `x.gdb`, and then launch gdb using the flag `-x <PATH_TO_SCRIPT>`.
This file will execute all of the gdb commands after gdb launches.
Alternatively, you can execute individual commands with `-ex '<COMMAND>'`.
You can pass multiple commands with multiple `-ex` arguments.
Finally, you can have some commands be always executed for any gdb session by putting them in `~/.gdbinit`.
You probably want to put `set disassembly-flavor intel` in there.

Within gdb scripting, a very powerful construct is breakpoint commands. Consider the following gdb script:

```gdb
start
break *main+42
commands
  x/gx $rbp-0x32
  continue
end
continue
```

In this case, whenever we hit the instruction at `main+42`, we will output a particular local variable and then continue execution.

Now consider a similar, but slightly more advanced script using some commands you haven't yet seen:

```gdb
start
break *main+42
commands
  silent
  set $local_variable = *(unsigned long long*)($rbp-0x32)
  printf "Current value: %llx\n", $local_variable
  continue
end
continue
```

In this case, the `silent` indicates that we want gdb to not report that we have hit a breakpoint, to make the output a bit cleaner.
Then we use the `set` command to define a variable within our gdb session, whose value is our local variable.
Finally, we output the current value using a formatted string.

Use gdb scripting to help you collect the random values in this level.
This may feel difficult, but will serve you well in your journey ahead.

### Level 6 - Modifying Data

---

As it turns out, gdb has FULL control over the target process.
Not only can you analyze the program's state, but you can also modify it.
While gdb probably isn't the best tool for doing long term maintenance on a program, sometimes it can be useful to quickly modify the behavior of your target process in order to more easily analyze it.

You can modify the state of your target program with the `set` command.
For example, you can use `set $rdi = 0` to zero out $rdi.
You can use `set *((uint64_t *) $rsp) = 0x1234` to set the first value on the stack to 0x1234.
You can use `set *((uint16_t *) 0x31337000) = 0x1337` to set 2 bytes at 0x31337000 to 0x1337.

Suppose your target is some networked application which reads from some socket on fd 42.
Maybe it would be easier for the purposes of your analysis if the target instead read from stdin.
You could achieve something like that with the following gdb script:

```gdb
start
catch syscall read
commands
  silent
  if ($rdi == 42)
    set $rdi = 0
  end
  continue
end
continue
```

This example gdb script demonstrates how you can automatically break on system calls, and how you can use conditions within your commands to conditionally perform gdb commands.

In the previous level, your gdb scripting solution likely still required you to copy and paste your solutions.
This time, try to write a script that doesn't require you to ever talk to the program, and instead automatically solves each challenge by correctly modifying registers / memory.

    ### Welcome to /challenge/embryogdb_level7!
    ###

    GDB is a very powerful dynamic analysis tool which you can use in order to understand the state of a program throughout
    its execution. You will become familiar with some of gdb's capabilities in this module.

    As we demonstrated in the previous level, gdb has FULL control over the target process. Under normal circumstances, gdb
    running as your regular user cannot attach to a privileged process. This is why gdb isn't a massive security issue which
    would allow you to just immediately solve all the levels. Nevertheless, gdb is still an extremely powerful tool.

    Running within this elevated instance of gdb gives you elevated control over the entire system. To clearly demonstrate
    this, see what happens when you run the command `call (void)win()`. As it turns out, all of the levels in this module
    can be solved in this way.

    GDB is very powerful!

### Level 8 - Broken Functions

The previous level showed you raw, but unrefined power.
This level will force you to refine it, as the `win` function will no longer work.
`break` at it, look around, and understand what is wrong.
